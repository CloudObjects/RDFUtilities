This library bundles various helper classes to simplify working with RDF data, especially the conversion of data between the formats used by [Semsol's ARC2 RDF library](https://packagist.org/packages/semsol/arc2) and [Markus Lanthaler's JSON-LD Processor for PHP](https://packagist.org/packages/ml/json-ld).
